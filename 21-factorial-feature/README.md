Mathematically, this is not true. In fact, the edge-case in this instance of a factorial method is that 0 factorial (0!) is equal to 1.

## Project Steps

This project follows the red-green-refactor cycle and guides you through the process of using test-driven development to create a factorial method. The factorial method is located inside an object named Calculate. You will be implementing your test code in the file `index_test.js`, and your implementation code in `index.js`.

The following steps should be completed in order:

1. Create a new test file `index_test.js` and add the first test case for a factorial function.
2. Run the test suite in the terminal and observe the failure.
3. Implement the factorial function in `index.js` to pass the first test case.
4. Add additional test cases to `index_test.js` and run the test suite again.
5. Refactor your implementation code in `index.js` to improve readability or performance.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until all test cases pass.

If you encounter any issues during this project, you can refer to the project walkthrough video available at the bottom of the page after completing the final step.
